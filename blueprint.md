# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that serves as a professional profile and portfolio. It is designed to be a central hub for showcasing skills, experience, and projects. The application will be built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and interactive user experience.

## Style and Design

The application will feature a modern and bold design aesthetic, incorporating the following elements:

*   **Typography:** Expressive and relevant fonts will be used to create a clear visual hierarchy. Hero text, section headlines, and other important text elements will be emphasized to guide the user's attention.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant color palette with a wide range of hues and concentrations will be used to create an energetic and engaging look and feel.
*   **Texture:** A subtle noise texture will be applied to the main background to add a premium and tactile feel.
*   **Visual Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows will be used to create a sense of depth. Interactive elements like cards will have a soft, deep shadow to appear "lifted."
*   **Iconography:** Icons will be used to enhance user understanding and navigation.
*   **Interactivity:** Interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and navigation will feature a "glow" effect to provide visual feedback.

## Features

The application will include the following features:

*   **User Profile:** A section to display user information, including a bio, skills, and experience.
*   **Project Showcase:** A portfolio section to display projects with descriptions, images, and links.
*   **Contact Form:** A form to allow visitors to send messages.
*   **Firebase Integration:**
    *   **Firestore:** The application will use Firestore to store and retrieve user data, project information, and contact form submissions.
    *   **Hosting:** The application will be deployed to Firebase Hosting.

## Current Plan

This is the initial setup of the project. The next steps will be to build out the individual pages and components of the application.
